# TriviaGame
This project contains a trivia game that prompts the user to answer questions about 80s TV shows. Hope you're a lover of the 80s. This page was designed using Bootstrap and is responsive.

Overview
1.  The game prompts the user to answer questions about 80s TV shows.
2. If the player selects the correct answer, it shows a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds the next question is automatically posed.
3. If the player runs out of time, the player is prompted that time's up and the correct answer is displayed. After a few seconds, the next question is automatically posed.
4. If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player is notified they selected the wrong option and then the correct answer is displayed. After a few seconds, the next question is automatically posed.
5. After all questions have been posed, the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and unanswered questions are displayed along with an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
